    <h3>Project Experience</h3>
    <pre>
I have had many project experiences over the years during my academic career and to show what I am capable of accomplishing I have listed some notable ones below.
</pre>
    <h4>Reverse Engineering the Software Architecture of Openpilot</h4>
    <pre>A group of students and I worked to reverse engineer OpenPilot, an open-source autonomous vehicle driving system. Our approach involved a deep dive into various components of the system to understand its inner workings. We examined the file structure in detail, which helped us identify key modules and how they interact within the codebase. We also analyzed the code references and dependencies to understand the flow of data and the decision-making processes that drive the vehicle’s autonomous behavior. In addition, we explored and utilized several software tools to assist with this process, such as code analysis tools, version control systems, and debugging software. These tools allowed us to efficiently navigate and comprehend the complex architecture of OpenPilot, facilitating a deeper understanding of its capabilities and design.</pre>
