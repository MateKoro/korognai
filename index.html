    <h3>Project Experience</h3>
    <p>I have had many project experiences over the years during my academic career. To show what I am capable of accomplishing, I have listed some projects of note below.</p>
    <br>

<!-- openpilot project -->
    <h4>Reverse Engineering the Software Architecture of Openpilot</h4>
    <a href="https://matekoro.github.io/EECS4314/index.html">Project Documentation</a>
    <pre>A group of students and I worked to reverse engineer OpenPilot, an open-source autonomous vehicle driving system. Our approach involved analyzing the file structure to identify key modules and their interactions within the codebase, as well as examining code references and dependencies to understand data flow and decision-making processes. To facilitate this, we utilized various software tools such as code analysis tools, version control systems, and debugging software, which enabled us to efficiently navigate and understand the complex architecture of OpenPilot. This process provided us with a deeper insight into the system’s capabilities and design.</pre>

<!-- sarit project -->
    <h4>Created Android Application for SARITS</h4>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/c6h_iIn8Tws">Video Presentation</a>
    <pre>A group of students and I created a ride-sharing application for vehicles known as SARITs. The app was initially designed for the York University campus to address the transportation needs of students, faculty, and staff. SARITs aim to provide an efficient, eco-friendly alternative to traditional transportation. The application allows users to easily book a ride, track the status of their SARIT, and share rides with others traveling along similar routes, optimizing the use of available vehicles. It also includes features like real-time ride updates, and a user-friendly interface. While initially tailored to the York University campus, the app's design has the potential to be adapted for other campuses or urban environments, offering scalability and flexibility for a wider range of users. Throughout the development of this project, we focused on user experience, system efficiency, and integrating autonomous vehicle technology into the app's operations. We also conducted extensive testing to ensure that the system would be reliable, secure, and easy to use for all users.</pre>
